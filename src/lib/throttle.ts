 * If the throttled function is called while the promise is already pending,
 * the call is queued to run after the pending promise completes plus `delay`,
 * and only the last call is invoked.
 * In other words, all calls and their args are discarded
 * during the pending window except for the most recent.
 * Unlike debouncing, this calls the throttled callback
 * both on the leading and trailing edges of the delay window by default,
 * and this can be customized by setting `leading` or `trailing.
 * It also differs from a queue where every call to the throttled callback eventually runs.
 * @returns same as `cb`
